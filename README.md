# US-Librarian-Data-Plot-in-Matplotlib

This file visualizes the number of librarians in major US cities across 50 states in Matplotlib and Folium. The comes from FiveThirtyEight and I have added longitude and latitude data. Please refer to the ipython notebook file.

You will have to run the file in your jupyter notebook to see the Folium map.
